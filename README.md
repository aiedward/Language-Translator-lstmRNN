# Project 4: Language translation using deep learning

In this project I'm training a sqeuence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences.
After training the model, it can translate new sentences from English to French

Since the dataset used only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of the thousands that we use, we'll be getting mixed results, depending on the words used for the translation.
For better results, the model needs to be trained on a bigger dataset, which takes a lot more time.
